Markdownizer
============

This is a cool markdown publisher in php.

How To...
---------

### ...use it ?

Just put these two files (`markdown.php`,  et `index.php`) in a directory accessible through your web server.

The file `markdown.php` comes from [http://michelf.com/projets/php-markdown](), __great thanks to him__ !

Note that the enchanced version _"PHP Markdown Extra"_ is used here !

### ...customize it ?

Just add a file `main.css` at the root of your site... and it'll work !
